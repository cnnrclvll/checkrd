# CHECKRD | 

Welcome to the CHECKRD Online Gaming Store, a mock-up collection experience of your favorite gaming titles. CHECKRD provides a seamless experience purchasing and storing games in your personal library. Explore titles via the homepage sliders, or search your favorite games by name.  Add multiple games to your cart and checkout to see them appear in your library.  CHECKRD is a mobile-first application designed exclusively for educational purposes.  None of the games that exist in the CHECKRD application are owned or available for sale from the CHECKRD store.

## Technologies

- **Tailwind CSS**: The application is designed using Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives us the ability to style our application in a unique and efficient manner.
- **SwiperJS**: We use Swiper, a modern touch slider, extensively for a mobile-friendly user interface.
- **CSS**: Alongside Tailwind CSS, we use vanilla CSS to style our application to ensure it is visually appealing.
