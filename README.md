# CHECKRD | ECommerce Application

Welcome to the CHECKRD Online Gaming Store, a mock-up collection experience of your favorite gaming titles. CHECKRD provides a seamless experience purchasing and storing games in your personal library. Explore titles via the homepage sliders, or search your favorite games by name.  Add multiple games to your cart and checkout to see them appear in your library.  CHECKRD is a mobile-first application designed exclusively for educational purposes.  None of the games that exist in the CHECKRD application are owned or available for sale from the CHECKRD store.

## Features
- **Homepage**: The homepage uses sliders to help you explore a number of popular titles.  Simply click on a game to learn more about it.
- **Sidebar & Search**: Use the hamburger button at the top-right of the application to open the sidebar.  From the sidebar you can register, login, visit your cart, or search for game titles by name.
- **Cart & Game Library**: Add games to your cart for later purchase using the 'Add to Cart' button.  From your cart you can remove games or click 'Checkout' to add them to your library.
